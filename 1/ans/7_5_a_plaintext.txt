Today, Internet service providers (ISPs) try to deliver more and more valueadded services integrated with their residential Internet access offer, such as triple-play
(voice, Internet, and video). This situation generates the need for more powerful and
expensive home devices to cover these needs. This device receives different names,
from customer premise equipment (CPE) to residential router and to home gateway
(HGW), but all have a common ground: the trade-off between low-cost and rich
functionalities, with a potentially negative effect on the device security. As a result,
vHGW was one of the first scenarios that were adopted within the NFV paradigm, to
demonstrate its potential in terms of efficiency and security. In this chapter, we are
going to describe the NFV architecture that Telefonica designed and implemented in a
commercial trial, to evaluate its potentiality.
