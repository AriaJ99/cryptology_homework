Container-based Virtualization provides a different level of
abstraction in terms of virtualization and isolation when
compared with hypervisors. In particular, it can be considered as a lightweight
alternative to hypervisor-based virtualization.
Hypervisors abstract hardware, which results in overhead in
terms of virtualizing hardware and virtual device drivers. A full
operating system (e.g., Linux) is typically run on top of this virtualized hardware
in each virtual machine instance. In
contrast, containers implement isolation of processes at the
operating system level, thus avoiding such overhead. These
containers run on top of the same shared operating system
kernel of the underlying host machine, and one or more
processes can be run within each container.
